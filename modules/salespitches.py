    phenny.say("Apertium is not ideal in all situations. It uses rule-based machine translation (RBMT), which is excellent for many, but not all, languages.")
    phenny.say("RBMT gives the best results for closely related languages. Apertium is specifically superior to Google Translate in this scenario, because Google Translate uses English as an intermediate.")
    phenny.say("Another advantage of RBMT is that it works for lesser-resourced languages. Neural machine tranlsation (NMT), used by Google Translate and many other systems, gives excellent results for languages with extremely large bilingual corpora, but breaks down for lesser-resourced languages. RBMT only requires someone who knows both languages and is willing to take the time to create a pair.")
